                                        <p class="caption">The term “Designer’s Deputy” was coined by Clarisse de Souza as one of the core concepts for her approach of a semiotic theory of designing user interfaces. This theory “Semiotic engineering” suggests a directionality to the flow of information during man-machine interaction where it’s the designer sending a message to the user through a medium.</p>

These pieces of information are artefacts of design processes within which designers anticipate the context of their application.</p>

Here the computer is the deputy of the designer, communicating one-shot messages of meta-communicative value to the user through predefined channels and codes.</p>

                                    <p class="caption">Therefore, each sign that gets to be read and understood by the user transmits some information about how to understand the other signs in the system, and each piece of knowledge derived from its set stems from the designer of the interface. Thus the instance that renders the designer’s message can be called “Designer’s Deputy”.</p>
                                    <p class="caption">In a nutshell, this means that man-machine interaction would effectively be restricted to unidirectional user-designer semiosis, even when extending to responsive and artificially intelligent interfaces as designers’ deputies.</p>

                                    <p class="caption">What does this mean for the design of intelligent interface agents? On the one hand, it motivates the design of meaningful interfaces that communicate through interaction itself, easing the use of increasingly complex applications, as it gives the designer a voice during interaction time.</p>
                                    <p class="caption">On the other hand it renders the Peircean concept of “perfect semiosis”, which results from the recursive interpretation of  signs as other signs and so on, impossible, as it suggests that there is in fact no interpretant being formulated by the computer.</p>
                                    <p class="caption" style="letter-spacing:0">In other words:<br>We cannot exchange meaning with a computer. Semiosis during interaction happens on the users side only, based on the signs that result from the semiotic process of designing the interface.</p>

Trying to design an interface within which information flow occurs bidirectionally means trying to generate a relative response to any meaningful input that might be sent by the user at the time of interaction.</p>

Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected “neurons”. The connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning.</p>
